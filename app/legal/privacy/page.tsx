          <p>
            This policy covers projectxprotocol.dev (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) only. Weir, the Prize
            Vault and the Draw service have their own privacy policies on their own domains.

          <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
          <p>
            The Site is a documentation site. It does not have accounts, does not connect to
            wallets, and does not collect names, emails or wallet addresses unless you send us one by
            email.
          </p>
          <p>
            We process: <strong>technical data</strong> — IP address, approximate location derived
            from it, browser and device type, referring page, pages viewed, timestamps — collected
            by our hosting and network providers (Vercel, Cloudflare) and by privacy-preserving
            analytics that does not use cookies and does not track you across sites; and{' '}
            <strong>correspondence</strong> — anything you send to our email addresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not use advertising cookies, do not sell personal data, and do not share it for
            cross-context behavioural advertising.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Why, and on what basis</h2>
          <p>
            Operating and securing the Site, preventing abuse, and understanding aggregate usage:
            legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). Responding to your messages: legitimate
            interests and, where relevant, contract. Complying with law: legal obligation.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            Our infrastructure providers (Vercel, Cloudflare, analytics provider) process data on
            our instructions under data-processing agreements. We disclose data to authorities where
            legally required. If the Site or the ProjectX intellectual property is transferred to a
            successor entity, correspondence and logs may transfer with it under this policy.
          </p>

          <h2>4. International transfers</h2>
          <p>
            Northlatch is a US company. Data may be processed in the United States. For EU/UK
            personal data we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum with our
            providers, or an adequacy decision where one applies.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Server and security logs: 90 days. Aggregated analytics: 14 months. Correspondence: 3
            years.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on where you live you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict,
            port, and object, and to complain to a supervisory authority. Email{' '}
            <a href="mailto:privacy@projectxprotocol.dev">privacy@projectxprotocol.dev</a>. We
            respond within 30 days (45 for California requests). California residents: we do not sell
            or share personal information as defined in the CCPA.
